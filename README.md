# holyc-nano
Basic syntax highlighting for HolyC/C+ (I prefer to call it C+) in GNU nano. Most of `hc.nanorc` is copied from the nanorc file for C, so if you're more familiar with HolyC feel free to contribute.

## Installing
Run `install.sh` within repo directory to install.
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/holyc-nano
~$ cd holyc-nano && chmod +x ./install.sh
~$ ./install.sh
```
