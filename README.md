# holyc-nano
Basic syntax highlighting for HolyC/C+ (I prefer to call it C+) in GNU nano.
I created this quickl for looking through the TempleOS source code. If you're more familiar with HolyC feel free to contribute.

Run `install.sh` within repo directory to install.
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/holyc-nano
